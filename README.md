# horiseon-refactor

## Description

This project was built to fix the vague coding in the semnatic html elements, then to reorganize the css to accommodate the new changes. Doing this gave a better understanding of the webpage layout just by looking at the html file and therefore to have less code in your htmk and css files. I learned that having a descriptive html elements and condensing your code so it isn't repetitive will help to get better at writing code.
